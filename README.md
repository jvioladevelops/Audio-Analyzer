##

A standard envelope contains four levels, Attack, Decay, Sustain, and Relase.

# Attack 
Is measured in time and controls the initial run up from 0 to peak amplitude

# Decay 
Is measured in time and controls the time taken to reach the sustain level from the peak

# Sustain
Is measured in amplitude and controls the level until the key is released

# Release
Is measured in time and controls the time as the amplitude reaches 0
